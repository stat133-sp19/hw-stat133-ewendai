Cooking Recipe

![cucumber lemonade](C:/Users/Yiwen/Desktop/Spring%202019/Courses/%5BStat%20133%5D/hw-stat133/warmup1/cucumberlemonade.png)

#### Recipe

##### [**cucumber lemonade**](https://smittenkitchen.com/2014/09/cucumber-lemonade/)

#### Ingredients

-   1 pound cucumber(s), peeled or unpeeled, cut into large chunks, plus a few extra thin cucumber slices for garnish
-   1 cup lemon juice (from about 7 to 8 lemons, although juiciness will vary)
-   1/3 cup granulated sugar
-   2 cups cold water

#### Special Tools

-   Blender
-   Strainer
-   Cheesecloths or coffee filter

#### Steps

1.  Run cucumber through a blender or food processor until pureed, then run it for a full extra minute to ensure that it's as processed as possible.
2.  Set a fine-mesh strainer or a regular strainer lined with a couple layers of cheesecloth or a coffee filter over a pitcher and pour cucumber puree through it, stirring to help it move along faster. Discard solids.
3.  In the pitcher, you should have about 1 cup cucumber juice. Add lemon juice and sugar to it, then water. Give it a good stir or shake, and let it sit in the fridge (to get it started chilling) for 15 minutes, after which a couple more stirs or shakes should leave the sugar fully dissolved.
4.  Taste lemonade, adding more sugar or water if desired.
5.  Serve chilled over ice.

#### Notes

Meant for hot summers! Picture above shows lemonade made with peeled cucumbers, can use unpeeled cucumbers, which will result in a greener looking drink.

Euclidean Distance
------------------

### **Definition** \[edit\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\bf \\overline {pq}$).

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean *n*-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

$$ d(\\textbf{p}, \\textbf{q}) = d(\\textbf{q}, \\textbf{p}) = \\sqrt{(q\_1 - p\_1)^2 + (q\_2 - p\_2)^2 + \\ldots + (q\_n - p\_n)^2} = \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n} (q\_i - p\_i)^2}.$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean *n*-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

$$||\\textbf{p}|| = \\sqrt{p\_1^2 + p\_2^2 + \\ldots + p\_n^2} = \\sqrt{\\textbf{p} \\cdot \\textbf{p}}$$
 where the last expression involves the dot product.
